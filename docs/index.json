[{"content":"\rIntro Sequential testing designs have gained significant popularity in AB testing due to their ability to potentially reduce the required sample size and experiment duration while maintaining statistical correctness. This approach allows for interim analyses of data as it accumulates, offering the possibility to stop the experiment early if a clear winner emerges, or if it becomes evident that the treatment effect is insufficient to justify continuing (stop for futility)\nIn this article, we shift our focus away from the theoretical intricacies of the problem and instead delve into a comprehensive exploration of available sequential testing solutions. We will discuss their implementations, compare their performance, and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. By examining these practical aspects, we aim to equip practitioners with the knowledge to make informed decisions when incorporating sequential testing into their AB testing workflows.\nApproach Among the variety of sequential testing designs, there are basically two broad families of algorithms: Group Sequential Testing (GST) and Always Valid Inference (AVI). These methods represent distinct philosophies in their handling of interim analyses and experiment stopping criteria..\nGST works with predefined interim analysis points and utilizes predetermined stopping boundaries to decide whether to stop the experiment at each stage.\nAVI allows continuous monitoring and providing valid confident intervals at any point, making it adaptable for uncertain experiment duration or analysis frequencies.\nThis article primarily focuses on these two techniques, providing an overview of their methodologies and practical implications.\nGroup Sequential Testing For group sequential testing there is a handy package in R and I will show below how to use it, although for those, who prefers Python due to any reason, whether it is the absence of an interpreter, infrastructure limitations or just personal preferences, there is no direct and popular alternative package, so I had to write it on my own and now ready to share with you after careful testing and benchmarking.\nGST in R If you\u0026rsquo;re ready to use R library there are two options: use R runtime directly or through rpy2 Python package. Both options are available for example within Google Colab environment.\nHere is an instance of rpy2 package inference within Colab Notebook, when you run R code from the Python interpreter using an extension.\niPython Notebook %load_ext rpy2.ipython %%R R.version.string install.packages(\u0026#34;ldbounds\u0026#34;) %%R library(ldbounds) ldBounds(t=seq(1/4, 1, 1/4), iuse=3, phi=1, alpha=0.05, sides=1)$upper.bounds [1] 2.241403 2.125078 2.018644 1.925452\rPython File The code above may be rewritten into a simple .py file as follows, you are to use created stats package as a plain Python package thereafter.\n⚠️ Caution\nIt will not work in Google Colab for instance, as it requires R installed in addition to Python.\nCode\rimport rpy2.robjects.packages as rpackages from rpy2.robjects.vectors import StrVector utils = rpackages.importr(\u0026#39;utils\u0026#39;) # select a mirror for R packages utils.chooseCRANmirror(ind=1) # R package names packnames = (\u0026#39;ldbounds\u0026#39;) # Selectively install what needs to be install. names_to_install = [ package for package in packnames if not rpackages.isinstalled(package) ] if len(names_to_install) \u0026gt; 0: utils.install_packages(StrVector(names_to_install)) stats = rpackages.importr(\u0026#39;ldbounds\u0026#39;) If R is not your cup of tea, or simply there is no option to run it within the scope of the production infrastructure, what is the most common limitation by the way, now begins exactly what you need.\nGST in Python There is quite popular yet inaccurate implementation powered by Zalando expan. It works without probability integration and mistakenly leverage alpha spending function as a critical value at each step, it\u0026rsquo;s common misunderstanding about alpha-spending function approach, there are number of implementations that do it in exact same way, and even world\u0026rsquo;s leading publication for data science, according to their own definition, sometimes makes the same mistake, for instance: Understanding of Group Sequential Testing published in Towards Data Science is good post for beginners, though alpha spending function\u0026rsquo;s application is misleading. As it will shown below that approach is statistically incorrect and so it\u0026rsquo;s highly recommended to avoid it.\nInstead I propose you to apply the new library seqabpy that is powerful and accurate and what is more important implemented according to the original papers Interim analysis: The alpha spending function approach by K. K. Gordon Lan and David L. DeMets (1983) and further related publications, you may find them all mentioned in Reference lines of the methods\u0026rsquo; docstrings, let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the functionality\nCode\rimport numpy as np import pandas as pd from scipy.stats import norm seabpy provides Group Sequential Testing in a separate module - gatsby which name is an anagram of Group Sequential AB Testing in PYthon and below it\u0026rsquo;s shown why gatsby is often referred as «The Great Gatsby»\n#!pip install seqabpy from seqabpy import gatsby Lan-DeMets calculate_sequential_bounds function implements rigorous approach to calculate confidence bounds in one-sided GST. In addition to upper bounds, if beta is provided it calculates lower bounds to unlock the option of stopping the test for futility, maintaining provided Type II error rate. The algorithm is taken from the article Group sequential designs using both type I and type II error probability spending functions by Chang MN, Hwang I, Shih WJ.

Wassmer and W. Brannath (2016)\nHere are a few examples, that shows how different peeking strategy affects the bounds:\ngatsby.ldBounds(t=np.array([0.3, 0.6, 1.0]), alpha=0.025) {'time.points': array([0.3, 0.6, 1. ]),\r'alpha.spending': array([4.27257874e-05, 3.76533752e-03, 2.11919367e-02]),\r'overall.alpha': 0.02499999999999991,\r'upper.bounds': array([3.92857254, 2.669972 , 1.98103004]),\r'nominal.alpha': array([4.27257874e-05, 3.79287858e-03, 2.37939526e-02])}\rin case of under-sampling the last upper bound is lower what reflects that all the rest of alpha volume is spent at this point in case of over-sampling the last upper bound is higher, what helps to control Type I error rate, after the expected sample size is reached gatsby.GST(actual=np.array([0.3, 0.6, 0.8]), expected=np.array([0.3, 0.6, 1]), alpha=0.025) array([3.92857254, 2.669972 , 1.96890411])\rgatsby.GST(actual=np.array([0.3, 0.6, 1.2]), expected=np.array([0.3, 0.6, 1]), alpha=0.025) array([3.92857254, 2.669972 , 1.98949242])\rUnder- and over- sampling may also happen in a more natural way, when a few peeking points are added or removed\ngatsby.ldBounds(t=np.array([0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0]), alpha=0.025) {'time.points': array([0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1. ]),\r'alpha.spending': array([4.27257874e-05, 3.76533752e-03, 8.40372704e-03, 1.27882097e-02]),\r'overall.alpha': 0.02499999999999991,\r'upper.bounds': array([3.92857254, 2.669972 , 2.28886308, 2.03074404]),\r'nominal.alpha': array([4.27257874e-05, 3.79287858e-03, 1.10436544e-02, 2.11404831e-02])}\rgatsby.GST(actual=np.array([0.3, 0.6, 0.8]), expected=np.array([0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1]), alpha=0.025) array([3.92857254, 2.669972 , 2.15083427])\rgatsby.GST(actual=np.array([0.3, 0.6, 1, 1.2]), expected=np.array([0.3, 0.6, 1]), alpha=0.025) array([3.92857254, 2.669972 , 1.98102292, 2.0375539 ])\rGST also supports int as an input, if peeking point are distributed uniformly it\u0026rsquo;s what you should use in sake of convenience\ngatsby.GST(7, 7) array([5.05481268, 3.48557771, 2.78550934, 2.38021304, 2.1113425 ,\r1.9168349 , 1.76778516])\rWhile the method comes handy in most of scenarios, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t support all the possible deviations: the beginning of the expected and actual peeking strategies must be the same: so it\u0026rsquo;s either over- or under- sampling or the change in peeking points when their number remains equal\nNeedless to say that the application of GST and other functions mentioned above apparently is not limited to one-sided hypotheses, in order to test two-sided alternative: just set $\\alpha$ to half of the value, like 0.025 if you want to challenge two-sided hypothesis at 0.95 confidence level, and define lower bounds symmetrically about zero, so they would be the same in absolute values, but negative.\ngatsby.GST(actual=np.array([0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2]), expected=np.array([0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1]), alpha=0.025) # the following will not work # gatsby.GST(actual=np.array([0.3, 0.6]), expected=np.array([0.8, 1])) # gatsby.GST( # actual=np.array([0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1]), # expected=np.array([0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 1]) # ) array([3.92857254, 2.669972 , 2.30467653, 2.05129976])\rAlways Valid Inference While AVI is becoming increasingly popular in the field, bypassing GST, it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that there are currently no widely adopted, comprehensive Python or R packages that focus solely on this approach.\nThere is one recent package savvi appeared this year, but it\u0026rsquo;s still in v0.. version and have not been yet fully acknowledged by the community. What is more it focuses only on the publications of Lindon et al. from 2022 and 2024, while there are other notable authors like Zhao et al. and Howard et al. whose approach will be challenged in addition to Lindon\u0026rsquo;s work\nfrom seqabpy import gavi seqabpy provides Always Valid Inference functionality in gavi module where as of now, AlwaysValidInference is a main class that implements confidence intervals valid at any point. While intervals and namely their continuous comparison to the current z-score provides the apparatus that is just enough for practical decisions, p-values are to be released later as well, to complete experiment analysis picture.\nAlwaysValidInference an array of sample sizes when the peeking happens along with the metric variance and the result point difference. Multiple supported properties comprise different algorithms (the detailed description may be found in each docsrting) that return a boolean array indicating whether the null hypothesis is rejected in favour of one- or two- sided alternative for each size.\navi = gavi.AlwaysValidInference(size=np.arange(10, 100, 10), sigma2=1, estimate=1) GAVI is the method proposed by Howard et al. and widely adopted in tech by Eppo\navi.GAVI(50) array([False, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True])\rmSPRT is the approach proposed by M. Lindon in his article and is leveraged by Netflix\navi.mSPRT(0.08) array([False, False, True, True, True, True, True, True, True])\rStatSig_SPRT is the variation proposed by Zhao et al. and as it comes from the name used currently by StatSig\navi.StatSig_SPRT() array([False, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True])\rThe last and, this time, indeed least heavily criticized statsig_alpha_corrected_v1 approach, which was their first attempt to furnish their platform with a sequential testing framework.

For demonstration purposes I suggest using Kim-DeMets spending function with different values of the power $\\phi$: the higher $\\phi$ the more strict the function is at the beginning of the experiment.\nCode\rgst_linear = gatsby.GST(actual=10, expected=10, iuse=3, phi=1, alpha=alpha) gst_quadratic = gatsby.GST(actual=10, expected=10, iuse=3, phi=2, alpha=alpha) gst_cubic = gatsby.GST(actual=10, expected=10, iuse=3, phi=3, alpha=alpha) You can play around the trade-off: would you like to spend more $\\alpha$ at the start, detecting faster if there are greater uplifts in you experiment group or to preserve the major part of alpha until the end keeping maximum power to reject the hypothesis when the expected sample size is reached.\n💡 Tip\nIf the title or the legend items are not visible to you - double click to one of legend items and it will make the chart rendered properly.

These tests are essential tools for researchers across various disciplines, enabling them to determine whether there is a significant correlation between the variables of interest.\nReal-world Relevance\nTo illustrate the practical significance of contingency tests, let\u0026rsquo;s consider a real-world scenario: imagine a market research team is investigating the relationship between customer satisfaction (a few levels e.g. Satisfied, Neutral, Dissatisfied) and the type of product purchased (there are multiple products) from an online marketplace. They collect data from a limited sample of customers who recently made purchases building a contingency table. By applying a contingency test, such as Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact or Chi-squared test, researchers can determine whether customer satisfaction and the type of product purchased are connected.\nFocus\nThis notebook embarks on a journey to explore the subtleties of Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact vs. Chi-squared tests application, delving into Fisher\u0026rsquo;s implementation nuances, and performance characteristics. A comparative analysis of two implementations of the Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test is covered: one crafted in pure Python and the other leveraging the statistical package of R through the rpy2 library. Furthermore, we\u0026rsquo;ll scrutinize the performance and accuracy of both approaches, comparing their results and dissecting their respective advantages.\nBackground: Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact and Chi-Squared Contingency Tables and Statistical Independence\nContingency tables serve as the foundation for these tests, presenting the observed frequencies of different combinations of categories for the two or more variables. By analyzing the distribution of frequencies within the table, contingency tests help to assess whether the observed patterns are likely due to chance or reflect a genuine interconnection between the variables.\nCode\rtable = [[1, 24, 5], [5, 20, 7], [14, 11, 7], [11, 14, 8], [10, 10, 10], [12, 12, 12]] Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact Test, a non-parametric statistical test, plays a pivotal role in hypothesis testing for categorical data. This test is particularly valuable when dealing with small sample sizes, where the assumptions of the chi-squared test are violated.\nDerivation of the Hypergeometric Distribution\nThe hypergeometric distribution arises from a scenario involving sampling without replacement from a finite population containing two types of objects: \u0026ldquo;successes\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;failures.\u0026rdquo; In the context of contingency tables, these objects correspond to the different categories of the two variables being analyzed.\nConsider a population of size N, containing K objects classified as \u0026ldquo;successes\u0026rdquo; and N-K objects classified as \u0026ldquo;failures.\u0026rdquo; We draw a sample of size n without replacement from this population. The hypergeometric distribution describes the probability of obtaining exactly k successes in the sample.\nThe Hypergeometric Distribution Formula\nThe probability mass function of the hypergeometric distribution is given by:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k} \\binom{N-K}{n-k}}{\\binom{N}{n}}$$\nwhere:\nN: Total population size K: Number of successes in the population n: Sample size k: Number of successes in the sample Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact Test: Applying the Hypergeometric Distribution\nFisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact Test leverages the hypergeometric distribution to calculate the exact probability of observing a given contingency table, or one more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis of independence between the variables. This exact probability is then used to assess the statistical significance of the observed association.\nChi-Squared The Chi-squared test is another widely used method for analyzing contingency tables to determine whether there is a significant connection between categorical variables. It relies on a statistical approach based on the Chi-squared distribution.\nChi-Squared Statistic: Measuring the Difference\nThe Chi-squared test calculates a test statistic, denoted by $\\chi^2$, which quantifies the difference between the observed frequencies in the contingency table and the frequencies expected under the null hypothesis of independence. The null hypothesis assumes that there is no association between the variables, meaning that the observed frequencies should be close to the expected frequencies.\nTesting the Null Hypothesis\nThe calculated chi-squared statistic is then compared to the chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom determined by the dimensions of the contingency table. If the table has $N \\times M$ size then degrees of freedom = $(N-1)(M-1)$\nAssumptions and Limitations\nBoth of these procedures, like any statistical test, operates under certain assumptions which are crucial for ensuring the validity of the test\u0026rsquo;s results. Their common requirements are:\nCategorical Data: The variables being analyzed must be categorical, meaning they can be divided into distinct categories or groups. Independent Observations: The observations in the contingency table should be independent of each other. This means that the outcome of one observation should not influence the outcome of another observation. In addition each of them has a third extra requirement\nFisher: Fixed Margins The row and column totals in the contingency table are considered fixed. This implies that the sample sizes for each category are predetermined.\nChi-squared: Sample sizes The expected cell frequencies should be sufficiently large for the chi-squared approximation to be valid\nApparently namely the third condition for each is the most challenging.\nThe third assumption for Fisher is quite strict and is not usually satisfied in practice. There are other representatives of exact test\u0026rsquo;s family that are free of this requirement like Boschloo\u0026rsquo;s or Barnard\u0026rsquo;s tests, although they are much more computationally expensive, as they require the nuisance parameters estimation and it\u0026rsquo;s not feasible to implement them for the tables larger than 2x2. So the performance is the main issue of the exact tests and if it\u0026rsquo;s the case then Chi-squared test is advised to be applied instead.\nFor Chi-squared violations of the third assumption can lead to inaccurate results. In such cases, Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test is often preferred due to its ability to handle small sample sizes and sparse tables where the chi-squared test\u0026rsquo;s approximations may not hold true.\nFisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact Test Implementation Pythonic Fisher NxM As long as widely used python packages for statistics like scipy or statsmodels don\u0026rsquo;t furnish Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test for tables larger than 2x2, here is the author\u0026rsquo;s pure Pythonic implementation for this procedure, to get more details follow the function documentation below.\nCode\rimport math def _pvalue(func: object, shape: tuple=(2,2)) -\u0026gt; str: print(f\u0026#34;p-value: {func([row[:shape[1]] for row in table[:shape[0]]]):.5f}\u0026#34;) def NxM_Fisher_exact_test(table: list[list]) -\u0026gt; float: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Performs Fisher\u0026#39;s exact test for a contingency table of an arbitrary size.

As the table size increases, the number of possible arrangements of data grows exponentially, making the calculations more time-consuming.\n_pvalue(NxM_Fisher_exact_test, shape=(3, 2)) p-value: 0.00014\rR Fisher NxM Another option that is to use rpy bridge from Python to R, this function works for an arbitrary shape of contingency table and unfortunately doesn\u0026rsquo;t have alternatives in Python.\nCode\rimport numpy as np import rpy2.robjects.numpy2ri from rpy2.robjects.packages import importr def R_fisher_exact_test(table: list[list]) -\u0026gt; float: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Performs exact Fisher\u0026#39;s test using R Parameters ---------- table: list[list] contigency matrix M x N Returns ------- p-value: float \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; # Enable automatic conversion between NumPy and R arrays rpy2.robjects.numpy2ri.activate() # Import necessary R package stats = importr(\u0026#39;stats\u0026#39;) # Perform Fisher\u0026#39;s test using the R function with more memory to get p-value result = stats.fisher_test(np.array(table), workspace = 2e9) # Extract the p-value p_value = result[0][0] return p_value Note that the rpy2 package has native dependencies, what in particular means that, installed R accompanied by the corresponding libraries is required.\n_pvalue(R_fisher_exact_test, shape=(3, 2)) p-value: 0.00014\rAlgorithmic Differences: Python vs R While both the Python and R implementations ultimately calculate the p-value for Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact Test, they employ distinct algorithms under the hood, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Understanding these differences is crucial for selecting the most appropriate implementation for a given scenario.\nPython: utilizes a recursive algorithm to enumerate all possible contingency tables that could arise under the null hypothesis. This approach, while conceptually straightforward, can become computationally expensive.\nR: in contrast, it leverages optimized algorithms and data structures that are specifically designed for efficient calculation of Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact Test. These algorithms, often implemented in compiled languages, take advantage of advanced numerical techniques and data representations to minimize computational overhead.\nPerformance Comparison Trade-offs and Considerations:\nThe choice between the Python and R implementations depends on the specific needs of the analysis. For smaller tables, the Python implementation may suffice, offering ease of understanding and implementation. However, as the table size increases, the computational advantages of the R implementation become more pronounced.\nI suggest we generate random contingency tables with dimensions ranging from 2x2 to 5x5, representing a diverse range of scenarios encountered in real-world applications. For each table size, we will measure the execution time required by both the Python and R implementations to calculate the p-value.\nCode\r%%time _pvalue(NxM_Fisher_exact_test, shape=(3, 2)) _pvalue(NxM_Fisher_exact_test, shape=(4, 2)) _pvalue(NxM_Fisher_exact_test, shape=(3, 3)) p-value: 0.00014\rp-value: 0.00012\rp-value: 0.00085\rCPU times: user 745 ms, sys: 7.96 ms, total: 753 ms\rWall time: 756 ms\rCode\r%%time _pvalue(R_fisher_exact_test, shape=(3, 2)) _pvalue(R_fisher_exact_test, shape=(4, 2)) _pvalue(R_fisher_exact_test, shape=(3, 3)) p-value: 0.00014\rp-value: 0.00012\rp-value: 0.00085\rCPU times: user 2.6 s, sys: 219 ms, total: 2.82 s\rWall time: 2.82 s\rCode\r%%time _pvalue(R_fisher_exact_test, shape=(4, 3)) p-value: 0.00149\rCPU times: user 1.46 s, sys: 97 ms, total: 1.55 s\rWall time: 1.88 s\rCode\r%%time _pvalue(NxM_Fisher_exact_test, shape=(4, 3)) p-value: 0.00149\rCPU times: user 8min, sys: 921 ms, total: 8min 1s\rWall time: 8min 5s\rFor sizes more than 2 x 5 and 3 x 3, R package function can significantly outperform the Python counterpart, whereas with tables of less size pure Python function is shining.\nThe results of the benchmarks revealed a clear trend: Python implementation is beaten in terms of execution time for larger tables. As the table dimensions increased, the performance gap between the two implementations is widened drastically. This observation aligns with the algorithmic differences discussed earlier, where the optimized algorithms and data structures employed by the R implementation proved to be more efficient.\nAs a rule of thumb I propose to apply R if $N \\times M \u0026gt; 10$, otherwise Python is preferable and what is more - it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any dependencies on non-native packages\nAccuracy Comparison Along with the performance let\u0026rsquo;s assure that the p-values generated by both methods are equivalent\nCode\rfrom scipy.stats import multinomial from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportion_confint P = np.arange(.1, .35, .05) n = 40 rv = multinomial(n, P) np.random.seed(2024) tol = 1e-5 alpha = 0.05 n_iterations = 100 for shape in [(2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3)]: false_positives = 0 for i in range(n_iterations): contingency_table = rv.rvs(shape[0]) p_value_py = NxM_Fisher_exact_test([row[:shape[1]] for row in contingency_table]) p_value_r = R_fisher_exact_test([row[:shape[1]] for row in contingency_table]) if abs(p_value_py - p_value_r) \u0026gt; tol: print(f\u0026#34;Different p-values! Python: {p_value_py}, R: {p_value_r}\u0026#34;) break elif p_value_py \u0026lt;= alpha: false_positives += 1 l, r = proportion_confint(count=false_positives, nobs=n_iterations, alpha=0.10, method=\u0026#39;wilson\u0026#39;) print(f\u0026#34;shape: {shape}, false positives: {false_positives/n_iterations:.3f} ± {(r - l) / 2:.3f}\u0026#34;) shape: (2, 2), false positives: 0.020 ± 0.026\rshape: (2, 4), false positives: 0.030 ± 0.030\rshape: (3, 3), false positives: 0.030 ± 0.030\rSo, it\u0026rsquo;s clear from multiple iterations for different tables and sizes that there is no a single case of different p-values, so the equivalence is practically evident. In addition I\u0026rsquo;ve checked Type I error level, it\u0026rsquo;s well below the bound of 5%, which means that ideologically the criterions are valid.\nPerformance Analysis: A Comparative Benchmark As the textbooks say, Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact Test stands out as a particularly versatile option when dealing with small sample sizes or sparse contingency tables. It provides accurate p-values, even when the assumptions of other commonly used test, such as the chi-squared test, might be violated. This benefit makes Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact test an invaluable method when working with limited data or situations where the chi-squared test\u0026rsquo;s approximation is not applicable.\nI offer you a procedure to challenge these statements, namely to call the power of the exact test out, when chi-squared assumptions are not satisfied. First we will check the correctness of these two methods and then the power.\nCode\rdef chi_squared_challenge( shape: tuple = (2, 2), n_iterations: int=1_000, alpha: float=0.05, aa_test: bool=True ) -\u0026gt; None: for i in range(1 + len(rv.rvs()[0]) - shape[1]): fisher_positives = 0 chi2_positives = 0 chi2_yates_positives = 0 zero_expected_count = 0 less_than_5 = 0 less_than_10 = 0 for _ in range(n_iterations): contingency_table = rv.rvs(shape[0])[:, i:i+shape[1]] if not aa_test: contingency_table[0] = contingency_table[0] ** 2 if np.min(contingency_table) == 0: zero_expected_count += 1 continue less_than_5 += np.max(np.array(contingency_table) \u0026lt; 5) less_than_10 += np.max(np.array(contingency_table) \u0026lt; 10) if shape == (2, 2): p_value_fisher = fisher_exact(contingency_table).pvalue p_value_chi2_yates = chi2_contingency(contingency_table, correction=True).pvalue if p_value_chi2_yates \u0026lt;= alpha: chi2_yates_positives += 1 else: p_value_fisher = NxM_Fisher_exact_test(contingency_table) p_value_chi2 = chi2_contingency(contingency_table, correction=False).pvalue if p_value_chi2 \u0026lt;= alpha: chi2_positives += 1 if p_value_fisher \u0026lt;= alpha: fisher_positives += 1 valid_tables = n_iterations - zero_expected_count print( f\u0026#34;\\nIf out of {valid_tables} valid {shape[0]}x{shape[1]} tables \u0026#34; f\u0026#34;(w/o zero expected count) number of tables with less than:\u0026#34; f\u0026#34;\\n - 5 elements in any cell is {less_than_5}\u0026#34; f\u0026#34;\\n - 10 elements in any cell is {less_than_10}\u0026#34; f\u0026#34;\\n Then p-values are:\u0026#34; ) l, r = proportion_confint(count=fisher_positives, nobs=valid_tables, alpha=0.10, method=\u0026#39;wilson\u0026#39;) print(f\u0026#34;Fisher positives: {fisher_positives/valid_tables:.3f} ± {(r - l) / 2:.3f}\u0026#34;) l, r = proportion_confint(count=chi2_positives, nobs=valid_tables, alpha=0.10, method=\u0026#39;wilson\u0026#39;) print(f\u0026#34;Chi2 positives: {chi2_positives/valid_tables:.3f} ± {(r - l) / 2:.3f}\u0026#34;) if not shape == (2, 2): continue l, r = proportion_confint(count=chi2_yates_positives, nobs=valid_tables, alpha=0.10, method=\u0026#39;wilson\u0026#39;) print(f\u0026#34;Chi2 Yates positives: {chi2_yates_positives/valid_tables:.3f} ± {(r - l) / 2:.3f}\u0026#34;) According to frequently encountered requirements in the literature regarding expected cell counts for chi-squared test application, a common rule is at least 5 (some requires 10) in all cells of 2x2 table, and 5 or more in 80% of cells in larger tables, but no cells with zero expected count. Furthermore, when the assumption for 2x2 table is not met, Yates\u0026rsquo;s correction is applied.\nNow, we will check the feasibility of these conditions for 2x2 tables first.\nCorrectness Code\rnp.random.seed(26) chi_squared_challenge(aa_test=True) If out of 969 valid 2x2 tables (w/o zero expected count) number of tables with less than:\r- 5 elements in any cell is 915\r- 10 elements in any cell is 969\rThen p-values are:\rFisher positives: 0.019 ± 0.007\rChi2 positives: 0.043 ± 0.011\rChi2 Yates positives: 0.011 ± 0.006\rIf out of 993 valid 2x2 tables (w/o zero expected count) number of tables with less than:\r- 5 elements in any cell is 566\r- 10 elements in any cell is 993\rThen p-values are:\rFisher positives: 0.024 ± 0.008\rChi2 positives: 0.050 ± 0.011\rChi2 Yates positives: 0.015 ± 0.006\rIf out of 1000 valid 2x2 tables (w/o zero expected count) number of tables with less than:\r- 5 elements in any cell is 178\r- 10 elements in any cell is 993\rThen p-values are:\rFisher positives: 0.032 ± 0.009\rChi2 positives: 0.052 ± 0.012\rChi2 Yates positives: 0.022 ± 0.008\rIf out of 1000 valid 2x2 tables (w/o zero expected count) number of tables with less than:\r- 5 elements in any cell is 27\r- 10 elements in any cell is 831\rThen p-values are:\rFisher positives: 0.033 ± 0.009\rChi2 positives: 0.049 ± 0.011\rChi2 Yates positives: 0.022 ± 0.008\rPower Code\rnp.random.seed(26) chi_squared_challenge(aa_test=False) If out of 969 valid 2x2 tables (w/o zero expected count) number of tables with less than:\r- 5 elements in any cell is 785\r- 10 elements in any cell is 969\rThen p-values are:\rFisher positives: 0.300 ± 0.024\rChi2 positives: 0.359 ± 0.025\rChi2 Yates positives: 0.265 ± 0.023\rIf out of 993 valid 2x2 tables (w/o zero expected count) number of tables with less than:\r- 5 elements in any cell is 373\r- 10 elements in any cell is 987\rThen p-values are:\rFisher positives: 0.325 ± 0.024\rChi2 positives: 0.370 ± 0.025\rChi2 Yates positives: 0.295 ± 0.024\rIf out of 1000 valid 2x2 tables (w/o zero expected count) number of tables with less than:\r- 5 elements in any cell is 90\r- 10 elements in any cell is 897\rThen p-values are:\rFisher positives: 0.334 ± 0.025\rChi2 positives: 0.363 ± 0.025\rChi2 Yates positives: 0.305 ± 0.024\rIf out of 1000 valid 2x2 tables (w/o zero expected count) number of tables with less than:\r- 5 elements in any cell is 9\r- 10 elements in any cell is 586\rThen p-values are:\rFisher positives: 0.351 ± 0.025\rChi2 positives: 0.387 ± 0.025\rChi2 Yates positives: 0.327 ± 0.024\rSurprise! In this example it\u0026rsquo;s shown there is no need for Yates nor for Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test at all! Chi-squared test doesn\u0026rsquo;t inflate the number of Type I errors and keep the power at least as high as it\u0026rsquo;s for the exact test regardless of the number of cells with low frequencies.\nJFYI: Some other exact tests might be applied instead of Fisher\u0026rsquo;s test, e.g. Boschloo\u0026rsquo;s test provides higher power but it\u0026rsquo;s a) much slower and b) yet worse than a plain chi-squared, you may prove it on your own as an exercise. Hint: there is a function boschloo_exact in scipy\nOkay, it\u0026rsquo; clear with 2x2, but what if the table is getting bigger?\nCode\rnp.random.seed(26) chi_squared_challenge(shape=(2, 4), aa_test=False) If out of 969 valid 2x4 tables (w/o zero expected count) number of tables with less than:\r- 5 elements in any cell is 804\r- 10 elements in any cell is 969\rThen p-values are:\rFisher positives: 0.685 ± 0.025\rChi2 positives: 0.688 ± 0.024\rIf out of 993 valid 2x4 tables (w/o zero expected count) number of tables with less than:\r- 5 elements in any cell is 388\r- 10 elements in any cell is 993\rThen p-values are:\rFisher positives: 0.666 ± 0.025\rChi2 positives: 0.672 ± 0.024\rThe power values are not statistically distinguishable, so chi-squared is still the winner as it\u0026rsquo;s much simpler in calculations and for the data model that I specified it seems that it can handle small table sizes - it takes low values at least as good as Fisher\u0026rsquo;s test.\nMonte-Carlo Simulation Results Interpretation I\u0026rsquo;d like to make an extra note that Monte-Carlo simulations can provide valuable insights into the performance and behavior of statistical tests, but it\u0026rsquo;s essential to interpret their results with caution and awareness of their limitations.\nWhile simulations can mimic real-world scenarios, they are inherently limited by the assumptions and parameters used in their design. They may not capture the full complexity of real-world data and may not be generalizable to all situations. Therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to consider the specific context and limitations of the simulation when interpreting its results.\nSaying that I must admit that I don\u0026rsquo;t have an intention to prove that there is no need for exact tests in any experiment design, I\u0026rsquo;d rather invite you to challenge your data and your experiments set up specifics, as there is a chance that you will find that chi-squared test is all you need for contingency experiments.\nJustification for Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact over Chi-Squared Even when the chi-squared test appears to perform well in Monte-Carlo simulations, there are compelling theoretical and practical reasons to prefer Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact Test in specific situations. Understanding these justifications is crucial for making informed decisions about which test to apply.\nSparse Table: Chi-squared test relies on approximations that may not hold true when dealing with sparse contingency tables. Sample Size: Chi-squared test is based on the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic, which assumes that the sample size is large. Effect Size: Chi-squared may be less sensitive in detecting the small effect size, because the approximation may not be as accurate. So, once again: in order to guarantee that you don\u0026rsquo;t have a need for exact tests in your data model setting, you must consciously simulate your data distributions (especially when it comes to sparse tables, small sample sizes and small effect sizes) and then make a decision, the process that I presented here is based on the data my team is exposed to most and hopefully it might be easily simulated with Multinomial distribution.\nGeneral Pipeline Finally I\u0026rsquo;d like to offer you a full pipeline on how to organize contingency tests efficiently: when Fisher\u0026rsquo;s exact test shall be applied and when Chi-squared is just enough.\nAs you know, exact tests could take time and what I want to achieve is to have a control over the time that I allocate to the function execution.\nThere are a few ways to implement timeouts, my favourite one is leveraging multiprocessing capabilities, however it\u0026rsquo;s not always the case that you can run a subprocess under your main process in production, so another concise way to apply timeouts will be shown via func_timeout library.\nConcurrent Execution Simple decorator to pass the output from the subprocess into main process.\nCode\rfrom typing import Optional from functools import wraps from multiprocessing import Queue, Process def subprocess_output(procedure: object, queue: Optional[Queue]=None) -\u0026gt; object: @wraps(procedure) def wrapper(*args, **kwargs): p_value = procedure(*args, **kwargs) queue.put(p_value) return p_value return wrapper def concurrent_test( method: object, table: list[list], name: str=\u0026#34;NxM Fisher\u0026#39;s exact test\u0026#34;, timeout: int=10, ) -\u0026gt; float: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Runs the given method in a separate process with a timeout.

This intelligent selection process ensures the validity and accuracy of the results. Flexibility and Control: Users have the flexibility to override the automatic selection and force the library to apply a specific test if desired. This feature is particularly useful when researchers have prior knowledge or preferences regarding the test to be used. User-Friendly Interface: The library\u0026rsquo;s interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, enabling researchers to effortlessly perform contingency tests without extensive coding or technical expertise. # !pip install podlozhnyy-module==2.6-alpha import podlozhnyy_module as pm Library\u0026rsquo;s application is as simple as the following command\npm.contingency.general_contingency_test(table[:5], criterion=\u0026#39;fisher-exact\u0026#39;, timeout=1) {'method': \u0026quot;NxM Fisher's exact test in R\u0026quot;, 'p-value': 0.0011288225617825118}\rpm.contingency.general_contingency_test(table[:3], criterion=\u0026#39;fisher-exact\u0026#39;, timeout=1) {'method': \u0026quot;NxM Fisher's exact test in Python\u0026quot;,\r'p-value': 0.0008451539443552633}\rConclusion: A Unified Framework for Contingency Tests This notebook has explored various aspects of contingency tests, with a particular focus on Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact Test comparison to Chi-squared test. As a part of the journey we have contrasted the Python and R implementations of the Fisher\u0026rsquo;s test, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in terms of performance, accuracy, and computational considerations.\nThe powerful framework of Monte-Carlo simulations is provided to enable the readers to simulate their data and ultimately apply proper testing techniques in their field providing the accurate guidance to the business.\npodlozhnyy_module library: a flexible solution\nThe code presented in this notebook has been thoughtfully integrated into the podlozhnyy_module library, offering a flexible and user-friendly solution for conducting contingency tests. This library empowers users to select the most appropriate test based on textbook rules or to override the default behavior and force the application of a specific test, such as Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact or the Chi-squared test.\n","permalink":"https://npodlozhniy.github.io/posts/contingency-test/","summary":"Why Fisher\u0026rsquo;s Exact test is the relic of the past and Chi-squared is all the way","title":"Mastering Homogeneity Hypothesis testing"},{"content":"\rBackground Hey, some time passed since the last post, where I described why it\u0026rsquo;s must to apply Dunnett\u0026rsquo;s correction for multivariate testing. This time I\u0026rsquo;m eager to open the topic of maturing metrics, particularly conversions, how to properly analyse the experiment with such a target, what are the options and which one is applied at HomeBuddy where we strive to squeeze maximum from every experiment.\nPrerequisites As usual the code snippets that are used for demo are written in Python, so to thoroughly follow the content, it\u0026rsquo;s better to have some exposure to the language and its main packages, although I\u0026rsquo;m adding extensive comments, so even if you\u0026rsquo;re not into programming you can grasp the pith anyway.\nDisclaimer: The actual notebook was written on Python 3.11.4 and to keep the results reproducible here is the list of particular packages that are being used specified with their versions.\nCode\rpip install --quiet --upgrade numpy==1.25.2 pandas==2.0.3 scipy==1.11.2 statsmodels==0.14.0 podlozhnyy_module==2.5.3 Data We need more data! This time the data simulation process is a little tricky than in case of a plain conversion as soon as we need to specify the maturation curve.\nIf you are not familiar with the concept of a maturation let me provide you with an example: imagine as a target in an AB experiment you have a deep conversion from a visit to a final goal, it may be an order for an arbitrary e-commerce web-site or the first payment in a mobile game.\nWhat all these deep actions usually have in common is that they are revenue-generating events which makes them a good proxy to measure the success of the experiment, from the other flip they take time to happen, depending on the specifics of the business, this could be even days or weeks.\nIn the context of HomeBuddy this might be an appointment or a deal that is our north star, as this is the reaper point where both sides (lead and contractor) reached their primary goal.\nIn order to avoid revealing the cards, I suggest we use an arbitrary maturation curve that is not inherited from our data, however it\u0026rsquo;s a pretty true-to-life example of how metric adds up to the final value.\nMaturation curves are usually might be described to a very high extent with Pareto distribution, which was initially developed to define a wealth\u0026rsquo;s distribution in the society, however the theory underneath is going way beyond widely known Pareto 80-20 principle as in essence it\u0026rsquo;s a parametric distribution that is good to define highly skewed data samples with a long heavy tail.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re interested in challenging your metric using the materials from the post, I suggest you give a shot to ParetoApprox function from my module that basically finds the best Pareto distribution parameters to fit the supplied array of the data, and voila you have a random variable that describes your metric and therefore you can do an infinite sampling and verify hypotheses about the applied techniques.\nFor this post let\u0026rsquo;s stop at one specific and quite realistic distribution of the metric maturation by days.\nCode\rimport numpy as np import pandas as pd import podlozhnyy_module as pm from tqdm.notebook import tqdm What\u0026rsquo;s important is barely we can expect that all visitors finally will reach the goal and hence while those, who will, can be described with Pareto, the major part of visitors will never convert and hence the true distribution of visitors is the sampling between never converted visitors and the rest of them, whose conversion day is distributed by Pareto.\nHopefully I\u0026rsquo;ve already created such an \u0026ldquo;Extended\u0026rdquo; Pareto distribution and you can define a metric of such a nature right out of the box: ParetoExtended in addition to Pareto specific alpha, loc and scale params is taking default_proba and default_value which means what ultimate percentage of visitors would never convert and which particular value should I assign to them, it\u0026rsquo;s an arbitrary (usually negative) number that stands on the left of X axis from the main Pareto distribution.\nCode\rf = pm.pareto.ParetoExtended( alpha=1.161, default_value=0, default_proba=0.5 ) As an example here is the metric where the ultimate conversion is a half of the users (and the other half is never converted) and their conversions happen accordingly to a textbook Pareto principle 80-20\nCode\rfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt plt.style.use(\u0026#39;dark_background\u0026#39;) def plot_maturating_curve(f: pm.pareto.ParetoExtended, xmin=0, ymin=None) -\u0026gt;

We explore a deep conversion, so the base value is a matter of tenths of a percent, in addition we will employ multivariate testing approach as it\u0026rsquo;s usually the case.\nCode\rfrom podlozhnyy_module.abtesting import ZDunnett from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportion_confint CONVERSION = 0.004 N_GROUPS = 3 DURATION_DAYS = 21 USERS_PER_DAY = 10_000 EFFECT_SIZE = 0.12 from scipy.stats import norm, binom def min_sample_size(mde: float, var: float, alpha: float=0.05, power: float=0.8): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; General-purpose calculator for T-test sample size.

However it totally makes sense to give some time to the recent users to have their conversions if you want to take them into account in the same way as those who came earlier, otherwise the latest users performance is neglected and the conclusion relies on those who came earlier mostly.\nThe final thought is that not every time well-known techniques fits your personal set up, in our case it was easy to show that movement to a baking window can only either (or even both simultaneously) drop the power down or push the experiment duration up, so the simpler default approach works uniformly better.\n","permalink":"https://npodlozhniy.github.io/posts/maturing-conversions/","summary":"Why you need to be patient and when cohort-wise approach is a flaw","title":"Maturing Conversions in AB-experiment"},{"content":"Background We at HomeBuddy run a various number of AB tests to improve customer journey. A big part of efforts is allocated to onboarding funnel, hence the main metrics are conversions throughout this funnel. Usually we design multivariate tests with a few testing groups reflecting slightly different variations (often in terms of actual design) of the business hypothesis behind. No matter how you run the experiments you want to get an accurate and powerful procedure, that\u0026rsquo;s why we use Dunnett\u0026rsquo;s correction for all of the experiments where we have to maximize the power of AB engine. Are you curious what it is?\nPrerequisites It\u0026rsquo;s expected that the reader has an experience with Python and its main libraries for data analysis. The actual notebook was written on Python 3.11.4 and to keep the results reproducible here is the list of particular packages that are being used in the article specified with their versions.\nCode\rpip install --quiet --upgrade numpy==1.25.2 scipy==1.11.2 statsmodels==0.14.0 podlozhnyy_module==2.4b0 Problem Definition Imagine we want to optimize an onboarding funnel of an arbitrary product applying a new business idea. We don\u0026rsquo;t want to rely on expert assessment only and hence opt for designing an AB test first. The target metric is an abstract conversion and we carry out a classical AB test with one treatment group.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not a secret that in such a scenario the best practice is a standard Z-test procedure for independent proportions\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2}{\\sqrt{P(1 - P)(\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2})}} \\space\\text{,where}\\space P = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1n_1 + \\hat{p}_2n_2}{n_1 + n_2} $$\nUnder the conditions of the truth of the null hypothesis the statistic follows the standard normal distribution\n$$ Z \\stackrel{H_0}{\\sim} \\mathbb{N}(0, 1) $$\nCode\rimport numpy as np from scipy.stats import binom from statsmodels.stats.proportion import proportions_ztest, proportion_confint There are multiple versions of classical Z-test in Python and even though those have its unique selling points this time I apply my own implementation to stay consistent across this article using the same interface for all criteria.\nCode\rfrom podlozhnyy_module.abtesting import Dunnett, Ztest Interface As a brief check that the method is working as expected and to make you acquainted with its interface let\u0026rsquo;s identify a dummy experiment\ninput must consist of at least three lists:\nbase is the basis event that stands as a denominator of conversion target is the goal event - conversion numerator groups are names of the experiment variants In addition variant is specified to explicitly define which group we\u0026rsquo;re focus on (it makes sense in case of multivariate testing)\nCode\rinput = { \u0026#34;base\u0026#34;: [ 480, 437, ], \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: [ 32, 37, ], \u0026#34;groups\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;control\u0026#34;, ], \u0026#34;variant\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;, } Functionality is written leveraging well-known OOP principles, so the experiment is not a function that stands aside, but a class which besides input dictionary gets the keys of the corresponding entities.\nCode\rtest = Ztest(input, base=\u0026#34;base\u0026#34;, target=\u0026#34;target\u0026#34;, groups=\u0026#34;groups\u0026#34;, variant=\u0026#34;variant\u0026#34;) print(f\u0026#34;p-value: {test.variant_pvalue(alternative=\u0026#39;less\u0026#39;):.3f}, Z-statistic: {test.statistic[0]:.3f}\u0026#34;) p-value: 0.151, Z-statistic: -1.032\rFor an on fly verification, the results might be compared to the output of a well known statsmodels package.\nCode\rcount = input[\u0026#34;target\u0026#34;] nobs = input[\u0026#34;base\u0026#34;] stat, pval = proportions_ztest(count, nobs, alternative=\u0026#39;smaller\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#39;p-value: {0:0.3f}, Z-statistic: {1:0.3f}\u0026#39;.format(pval, stat)) p-value: 0.151, Z-statistic: -1.032\rThe numbers coincide and now we\u0026rsquo;re ready to move to the main topic.\nTheory While often basic Z-test procedure is the appropriate option for AB analysis, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t satisfy the genuine requirements for the statistical method when it comes to multiple hypothesis testing. I hope you understand what is the problem in case of having $n$ independent metrics in your test: if you set up acceptable Type I error rate $\\alpha$ for each of them then the total probability to get at least one significant difference (dubbed as FWER) under the conditions of the truth of the null hypothesis (which means no difference between the groups by design) would be not $\\alpha$ but $1 - (1 - \\alpha)^n$ what totally invalidates the procedure.\nThere are two possible scenarios: either we have multiple metrics that we want to compare across the test and control group or we have several testing groups that apply different treatment to customers. Whilst the first problem is more popular by a wide margin and has lots of solutions, the second one is often neglected in the business industry and generally the same procedures are used to solve it. If you apply any type of corrections for multiple testing you\u0026rsquo;re already ahead of 80% of teams that don\u0026rsquo;t, although what I want to show you is that the second scenario must be treated differently to extract more insights from your experiments.\nDunnet\u0026rsquo;s test is a multiple comparison procedure developed specifically to compare each of a number of treatment groups to a control one, extended original paper was released in 1964. Dunnett\u0026rsquo;s test is not a set aside procedure but more like an extension of monumental Student\u0026rsquo;s T-test, for a specific design where every treatment group is compared to a single control one, which is leveraged to take into account the dependencies between comparisons. In case of proportions it\u0026rsquo;s a Z-test, as long as we don\u0026rsquo;t need to estimate variance for binomial distribution in addition to the probability of success.\nThe main trick is to calculate variance in a different way, just to remind you in case of a standard procedure statistic looks like\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2}{S\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}}} $$\nwhere $S$ is a standard error estimate comprises the squared root of variance of a combined sample $\\sigma^2 = P(1 - P)$\nDunnett\u0026rsquo;s test statistic looks exactly the same for every treatment group with the only difference laying under how variance is calculated. In general in case of $n$ treatment groups and one control group $i=0$ of observations $(X_0, .. X_{N_i})$ with $N_i$ size of each, the formula is the following:\n$$ S^{2} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{n}S_i^2}{df} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_i}(X_{ij} - \\bar{X_i})^2}{df} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{N_i}X_{ij}^2 - n\\bar{X_i}^2}{df} $$\nwhere $df$ is degrees of freedom\n$$ df = \\sum_{i=0}^{n}N_{i} - (n + 1) $$\nFor proportions this \u0026ldquo;pooled\u0026rdquo; variance simplifies even further as long as the rest part of calculations is exactly the same\n$$ S^{2} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{n}{N_i\\bar{p_i}(1 - \\bar{p_i})}}{df} $$\nCanonical AB test First of all, to guarantee the accuracy we should challenge this specific criterion against a classical one in case when both of them are applicable - standard AB test. What is good about proportions is that we can easily simulate the data in the blink of an eye, so we\u0026rsquo;re setting up a simulation and employ Monte Carlo process to check two things:\ncorrectness - the criterion should meet the identified confidence level, which means that in case of AA comparison we should get Type I error in $\\alpha$ percent of experiments power - as it comes from the theory in case of only two groups Dunnett\u0026rsquo;s test is equal to a classical Z-test, so shall we call the implementation out? In addition to a point estimate of False Positive Rate I suggest building a 90% confidence interval to be more precise in the comparisons\nCode\rdef generate_sample(size: int, prob: float) -\u0026gt; int: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Return the number of target events \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; return binom(n=size, p=prob).rvs() Correctness in AA Code\rnp.random.seed(2024) alpha = 0.05 n_iterations = 1000 p_general = 0.1 input = dict.fromkeys([\u0026#34;base\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;names\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;variant\u0026#34;]) input[\u0026#34;names\u0026#34;] = [\u0026#34;A\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;B\u0026#34;] input[\u0026#34;variant\u0026#34;] = \u0026#34;B\u0026#34; for size in map(int, [1e2, 1e3, 1e4]): dunnett_positives = 0 z_positives = 0 for i in range(n_iterations): input[\u0026#34;base\u0026#34;] = [size, size] input[\u0026#34;target\u0026#34;] = [generate_sample(size, p_general), generate_sample(size, p_general)] dunnett_test = Dunnett(input, \u0026#34;base\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;names\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;variant\u0026#34;) z_test = Ztest(input, \u0026#34;base\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;names\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;variant\u0026#34;) dunnett_p_value = dunnett_test.variant_pvalue(alternative=\u0026#34;two-sided\u0026#34;) z_p_value = z_test.variant_pvalue(alternative=\u0026#34;two-sided\u0026#34;) if dunnett_p_value \u0026lt;= alpha: dunnett_positives += 1 if z_p_value \u0026lt;= alpha: z_positives += 1 print(f\u0026#39;FPR for sample size {size}\u0026#39;) l, r = proportion_confint(count=dunnett_positives, nobs=n_iterations, alpha=0.10, method=\u0026#39;wilson\u0026#39;) print(f\u0026#39;Dunnet: {dunnett_positives / n_iterations:.3f} ± {(r - l) / 2:.3f}\u0026#39;) l, r = proportion_confint(count=z_positives, nobs=n_iterations, alpha=0.10, method=\u0026#39;wilson\u0026#39;) print(f\u0026#39;Z-test: {z_positives / n_iterations:.3f} ± {(r - l) / 2:.3f}\u0026#39;) print() FPR for sample size 100\rDunnet: 0.048 ± 0.011\rZ-test: 0.048 ± 0.011\rFPR for sample size 1000\rDunnet: 0.050 ± 0.011\rZ-test: 0.050 ± 0.011\rFPR for sample size 10000\rDunnet: 0.051 ± 0.011\rZ-test: 0.051 ± 0.011\rAmazing!

I prefer Sidak-Holm procedure as it\u0026rsquo;s known as the most powerful procedure that controls FWER, however as long as sample size is increased the difference from Bonferroni-Holm is hardly noticeable.\nCode\rdef sidak_holm(p_values: np.ndarray, alpha: float) -\u0026gt; np.ndarray: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Step down Sidak-Holm procedure If the statistics are jointly independent, no procedure can be constructed to control FWER that is more powerful than the Sidak-Holm method \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; m = p_values.size adjusted_alpha = np.array([1 - (1 - alpha) ** (1 / (m - i + 1)) for i in range(1, m + 1)]) sorted_indexes = np.argsort(p_values) sorted_pvalues = p_values[sorted_indexes] first_reject = (list(sorted_pvalues \u0026lt;= adjusted_alpha) + [False]).index(False) result = np.array([True] * first_reject + [False] * (m - first_reject)) return result[np.argsort(sorted_indexes)] For the power test I offer to use two treatment groups and a single control where in one of the treatments an effect of 20% uplift is added. So the null hypothesis should be rejected and True Positive Rate is measured - is the share of rejected hypotheses among the number of iterations.\nCode\rnp.random.seed(2024) for size in [1e2, 5e2, 1e3, 5e3]: _ = monte_carlo(aa_test=False, group_size=int(size)) TPR of 20% effect size for sample size 100\r- Dunnett: 0.051 ± 0.011\r- Z-Test: 0.043 ± 0.011\rTPR of 20% effect size for sample size 500\r- Dunnett: 0.104 ± 0.016\r- Z-Test: 0.092 ± 0.015\rTPR of 20% effect size for sample size 1000\r- Dunnett: 0.265 ± 0.023\r- Z-Test: 0.240 ± 0.022\rTPR of 20% effect size for sample size 5000\r- Dunnett: 0.855 ± 0.018\r- Z-Test: 0.842 ± 0.019\rThe results are promising! The power of Dunnett\u0026rsquo;s test every time exceeds the power of Z-test with Sidak-Holm procedure applied. The difference is not significant though, so we can\u0026rsquo;t say for sure that it\u0026rsquo;s better, let\u0026rsquo;s experiment more with parameters and change effect_size\nCode\rnp.random.seed(2024) for effect_size in [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]: _ = monte_carlo(aa_test=False, group_size=3000, effect_size=effect_size) TPR of 10% effect size for sample size 3000\r- Dunnett: 0.163 ± 0.019\r- Z-Test: 0.157 ± 0.019\rTPR of 20% effect size for sample size 3000\r- Dunnett: 0.589 ± 0.026\r- Z-Test: 0.569 ± 0.026\rTPR of 30% effect size for sample size 3000\r- Dunnett: 0.927 ± 0.014\r- Z-Test: 0.914 ± 0.015\rIt\u0026rsquo;s exciting, the result remains the same, and if we know that Sidak-Holm is the most powerful method that controls FWER for the general use case, we see now that Dunnett\u0026rsquo;s at least not worse. Finally, the most appealing variable is the number of treatment groups, let\u0026rsquo;s vary it too.\nCode\rnp.random.seed(2024) for n_groups in [3, 5, 7]: _ = monte_carlo(aa_test=False, group_size=3000, n_groups=n_groups) TPR of 20% effect size for sample size 3000\r- Dunnett: 0.608 ± 0.025\r- Z-Test: 0.601 ± 0.025\rTPR of 20% effect size for sample size 3000\r- Dunnett: 0.544 ± 0.026\r- Z-Test: 0.506 ± 0.026\rTPR of 20% effect size for sample size 3000\r- Dunnett: 0.464 ± 0.026\r- Z-Test: 0.424 ± 0.026\rNow we\u0026rsquo;ve nailed it! The number of groups is what affects the bottom line. The more groups are in the experiment - the more powerful Dunnett\u0026rsquo;s Correction than Sidak-Holm. So, let\u0026rsquo;s build a title image for this article that illustrates how Dunnett\u0026rsquo;s test outperforms the well-known step-down procedure as the number of treatment groups increases.\nCode\rfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm np.random.seed(2024) ztest_values = [] dunnett_values = [] for n_groups in tqdm(range(2, 16)): result = monte_carlo(aa_test=False, verbose=False, group_size=3000, n_groups=n_groups) dunnett_values.append(result[\u0026#34;dunnett\u0026#34;]) ztest_values.append(result[\u0026#34;z-test\u0026#34;]) Plotly is used for interactive visualization, hover over the image to see details.\nCode\rimport plotly.express as px import plotly.graph_objs as go def hex2rgba(hex, alpha): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;

In order to include a seasonal component, set this to a whole number greater than 1. For example, if the data represent daily observations, use 7 for a day-of-week component. This interface currently only supports up to one seasonal component. season_duration: Duration of each season, i.e., number of data points each season spans. For example, to add a day-of-week component to data with daily granularity, use model_args = list(nseasons = 7, season_duration = 1). To add a day-of-week component to data with hourly granularity, set model_args = list(nseasons = 7, season_duration = 24). alpha : Desired tail-area probability for posterior intervals. Defaults to 0.05, which will produce central 95% intervals Other Parameters ---------------- **kwargs : model_args variables, available options: ndraws: number of MCMC samples to draw. More samples lead to more accurate inferences. Defaults to 1000. nburn: number of burn in samples. This specifies how many of the initial samples will be discarded. defaults to 10% of ndraws. standardize_data: whether to standardize all columns of the data before fitting the model. This is equivalent to an empirical Bayes approach to setting the priors. It ensures that results are invariant to linear transformations of the data. prior_level_sd: prior standard deviation of the Gaussian random walk of the local level. Expressed in terms of data standard deviations. Defaults to 0.01. A typical choice for well-behaved and stable datasets with low residual volatility after regressing out known predictors. When in doubt, a safer option is to use 0.1, as validated on synthetic data, although this may sometimes give rise to unrealistically wide prediction intervals. dynamic_regression: whether to include time-varying regression coefficients. In combination with a time-varying local trend or even a time-varying local level, this often leads to overspecification, in which case a static regression is safer.

work smarter, not harder - if you\u0026rsquo;re inventing a bicycle writing SQL alike transformations in Pandas, nobody beyond your internal perfectionist will reward it.\nPandas alternative Code\rtemp = orders[ ( (orders[\u0026#34;City\u0026#34;] == \u0026#34;Accra\u0026#34;) | (orders[\u0026#34;City\u0026#34;] == \u0026#34;Lisbon\u0026#34;) ) \u0026amp;

The burgers which is the main cuisine were not so popular this day, but there were spikes for the meals for the group of people and \u0026ldquo;romantic\u0026rdquo; food, namely Japanese (Sushi) \u0026amp; Italian (Pizza) as well as Breakfast, Ice Cream, Desserts Average Check: During the top weekdays in addition to orders number the average order values grows, not only more people order, but each person order more Accra: Delivered Percentage: first of all the delivered percentage for Accra is less than for Lisbon in general (statistical significance is checked below) and the second point is more accurate look at the dynamic, indeed there were some problems on Feb 7 (driver: ios failed) \u0026amp; Feb 28 (driver: android rejected) Delivery Time: there is a positive trend in delivery time, one of the reasons can be the launch of the new suppliers, but it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to check precisely using the given time frame only Conclusion Instead of Summary: If you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough time, to go too much in detail (it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that one can solve only well formulated problems, sometimes it only means that a person indeed doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much time) use this high-level approach to explore you data and get immediate insights about your data structure; because after all arbitrarily amount of time can be spent on researching the data, but business never wants to wait.\n","permalink":"https://npodlozhniy.github.io/posts/timeseries-analysis/","summary":"Intro It\u0026rsquo;s a short yet handy guide on how to analyze time series data in a few clicks using modern Python libraries.\nTech stack for this guide consists of\nduckdb and pandas packages for data processing Facebook\u0026rsquo;s prophet for data exploration and forecasting plotly for data visualization Code\rimport duckdb as db import pandas as pd import numpy as np orders = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;orders_data.csv\u0026#39;) orders.sample() Created Date Country City Restaurant ID Restaurant Name Order State Cancel Reason Cuisine Platform Products in Order Order Value € (Gross) Delivery Fee Delivery Time Order ID 44255 10.","title":"Time Series Analysis in Python"}]
